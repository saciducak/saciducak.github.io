**Architecting Intelligence. Bridging Computer Vision & LLMs.**

Welcome to my digital headquarters. This portfolio is more than just a list of projects; it's a living interface into my work as an AI Engineer and Entrepreneur. It is designed to be minimal, deeply interactive, and performance-first—mirroring the philosophy I bring to every system I build.

## 🚀 About This Repo

This is the source code for my personal portfolio, built to showcase:
-   **Deep Tech Ventures**: My work with **Shetland Tech** (Neural-Agri Interfaces) and **FlorGarden** (AI-driven Soilless Agriculture).
-   **Selected Works**: High-impact projects ranging from Multi-Agent RAG systems to Workforce Management SaaS.
-   **Community**: My "United We" initiative, focused on open-source growth and knowledge sharing.

## 🛠️ The Stack

I believe in tools that get out of the way. This site is crafted with:
-   **React 18** for a fluid, reactive UI.
-   **Tailwind CSS** for sharp, pixel-perfect styling.
-   **Framer Motion / Anime.js** concepts for the "Biosphere" and "Neural" visualizations.
-   **Vite** for lightning-fast builds.

## 🌿 Philosophy

> "We don't just build code; we cultivate ecosystems."

Whether it's optimizing a YOLO model for plant disease detection or designing a scalable LLM pipeline, my focus is always on **precision** and **impact**. This site reflects that—no clutter, just signal.
